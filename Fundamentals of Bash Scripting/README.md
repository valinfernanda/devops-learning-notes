Task
1. Create a Bash script to check disk usage on the server.
If the disk usage exceeds 80% (this threshold is just an example and can be adjusted based on your server's needs), the script should send a notification to Discord.

The main goal is for the script to send an alert whenever disk usage goes beyond the defined limit.

2. Set up a cronjob to run this Bash script every 30 minutes.
