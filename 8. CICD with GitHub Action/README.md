Task 

1. Create a simple application (Node.js application that simply displays Hello World.)
● The application must be executable using a Dockerfile.
● Push the application code to the GitLab Git repository
2. Create a single CI/CD process in GitLab: build to image push. Pushing the image to staging is automated, while pushing to production is done manually.
