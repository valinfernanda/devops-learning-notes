This is my personal documentation on Networking, Security, and Orchestration of Docker. The documentation is currently written in Indonesian, but if you would like an English version, 
I would be happy to translate it. The full documentation is available in a PDF located in the same folder.


Task
1. Create a Docker Compose file to run 2 services:
A backend service
A MySQL database service

2. Use a Docker Volume to persist data from the MySQL database (so data is not lost when the container restarts or is removed).

3. Ensure the containers are connected to each other through a Docker network (so the backend can communicate with the database).
