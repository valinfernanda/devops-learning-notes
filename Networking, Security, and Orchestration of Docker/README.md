Task
1. Create a Docker Compose file to run 2 services:
A backend service
A MySQL database service

2. Use a Docker Volume to persist data from the MySQL database (so data is not lost when the container restarts or is removed).

3. Ensure the containers are connected to each other through a Docker network (so the backend can communicate with the database).
